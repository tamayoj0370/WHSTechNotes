To me, “brain rot” perfectly describes that drained, foggy feeling after spending too much time scrolling through pointless content. This year, I’ve felt both the good and bad sides of digital media. On one hand, it keeps me connected and entertained, but on the other, it’s easy to get stuck in a cycle of watching or reading things that feel like a waste of time. The word “slop” hits home because so much of what I see online, especially the AI-generated stuff, feels repetitive or low effort. But then there’s “lore,” which reminds me of how technology can also bring out creativity and community, like in fandoms or storytelling spaces. I think it’s possible to balance meaningful engagement with technology while avoiding brain rot, but it takes effort—like being intentional about what I consume and setting limits on how much time I spend online.

Government intervention has a significant impact on technology companies and their users by shaping how platforms operate and how accessible they remain. In TikTok’s case, the potential ban due to national security concerns shows how governments prioritize data privacy and national security over free access to global platforms. For users, this can mean losing access to a platform they enjoy, while for companies, it might require major changes, such as storing data locally or even restructuring ownership, to meet regulatory requirements. This situation highlights the delicate balance between innovation and compliance with government regulations.

If I were a developer at TikTok, I would implement a feature that provides users with complete transparency regarding how their data is stored and shared. For example, a “Data Dashboard” within the app could allow users to see where their data is stored, who has access to it, and the option to delete specific data points. This feature would address privacy concerns and show that TikTok is taking user data seriously. From this situation, I’ve learned the importance of incorporating privacy and security considerations early in app development. Applying these principles to my projects would not only align with ethical software development but also build trust with users, ensuring the longevity and reliability of the product.

Aviation safety depends on technology, especially in air traffic control (ATC) and automation. ATC systems use complex algorithms to track aircraft, manage airspace, and prevent collisions in real time. But when software errors, outdated systems, or miscommunication between different technologies occur, the results can be disastrous. Strengthening AI-driven decision-making in ATC could help detect potential risks faster than human controllers and offer immediate solutions. On top of that, improving redundancy in communication—like using more reliable satellite-based tracking—would reduce the chances of accidents caused by system failures or gaps in coordination.

Human-computer interaction (HCI) also plays a huge role in aviation safety. Pilots and air traffic controllers rely on clear, intuitive interfaces to make quick decisions, but poorly designed systems can slow them down or cause confusion. If an interface bombards pilots with too many alerts or unclear warnings, it increases the risk of human error. To avoid this, aviation software needs to focus on user-friendly designs with clear visual and auditory cues that make critical information easy to process. AI copilots could also help by interpreting alerts and suggesting the best course of action, reducing stress and improving safety in high-pressure situations.

My application, PlayIQ, would be an AI-powered decision-making assistant for NFL coaches, leveraging real-time data to suggest optimal plays based on the current game situation. It would integrate live player tracking, historical performance metrics, and opponent tendencies to provide instant recommendations. Features would include heatmaps displaying player movement, predictive models for fourth-down conversions, and fatigue tracking to prevent injuries. A user-friendly dashboard would highlight key insights, such as a team’s success rate on specific plays against different defensive formations, giving coaches an edge in high-pressure moments.

To efficiently store and process this vast amount of data, PlayIQ would use a combination of databases and in-memory data structures. SQL databases would store long-term historical data, while dictionaries and lists in Python would handle real-time play-by-play updates for quick access. Machine learning algorithms would analyze past games to predict play success rates, while sorting and searching algorithms would ensure rapid retrieval of relevant stats. Visualizations like line graphs for player fatigue trends, bar charts for play success comparisons, and heatmaps for defensive coverage would make data easily interpretable, allowing coaches to make informed, strategic decisions in seconds.

Technology can serve as a vital bridge between generations by helping educators and service providers stay updated on evolving youth slang. AI-powered language translation tools, online slang dictionaries, and even social media trend trackers can provide real-time insights into how young people communicate. Educational apps or AI chatbots integrated with slang recognition could help professionals decode informal language while maintaining the context and intent of conversations. However, these tools must be designed with cultural sensitivity in mind, ensuring that slang is understood within its proper social and linguistic framework rather than misinterpreted or stripped of its nuance. By leveraging technology responsibly, educators can foster stronger connections with students while avoiding generational misunderstandings.

Despite the potential benefits, integrating slang translation into educational settings presents challenges. A major concern is maintaining professionalism while respecting youth culture—some slang terms may carry connotations that are inappropriate for formal environments, making it difficult to determine what should be acknowledged versus discouraged. Additionally, language evolves so quickly that any formal attempt to track and teach slang may become outdated or even feel forced, potentially alienating students rather than engaging them. Misunderstandings of slang can also create unintended conflicts; for example, a counselor misinterpreting a term might dismiss a student’s concerns or escalate a situation unnecessarily. Instead of rigidly formalizing slang education, schools and youth organizations should encourage open dialogue where both educators and students can share language organically, using technology as a support tool rather than a strict translator.

Over spring break I spent a lot of time using entertainment and communication technology. I watched Netflix and YouTube, mainly focusing on shows and crochet tutorials. Netflix was my go-to for relaxation while YouTube helped me learn new crochet techniques, which I plan to use for my crochet business. FaceTime was another big part of my break since I used it to stay in touch with friends and family. TikTok, on the other hand, was mostly mindless scrolling—what some might call “brain rot”—but occasionally. I came across creative ideas or funny videos that kept me entertained.

Some of my technology use connects to what we learn in class, especially regarding problem-solving and app functionality. For example, watching crochet tutorials on YouTube required me to analyze patterns and troubleshoot mistakes, which is similar to debugging in coding. The way apps like TikTok and Netflix recommend content is also tied to algorithms a key part of programming and game development. Even FaceTime relies on coding and app design to provide seamless video calls. While I mostly used technology for fun over the break it still involved aspects of learning and problem-solving that relate to class concepts.

Technology has changed how I see March Madness, especially with AI predictions like creating perfect brackets. While it’s cool to see these predictions, they take away from the unpredictability that makes the tournament so exciting. Part of the thrill of March Madness is watching unexpected upsets and Cinderella teams surprise everyone, but when AI starts predicting outcomes, it can feel like there’s less surprise. Still, it’s interesting to see how these tools change the way we analyze and think about the game.

Social media and streaming services have also made it easier for fans to connect with the tournament. Watching games live and interacting with fans on platforms like Twitter or Instagram adds a new layer to the experience. We get more behind-the-scenes content, highlights, and real-time reactions, which makes the games feel closer and more personal. It’s a big shift from the traditional way of watching games, and it definitely changes how we connect with March Madness.

Lately, I’ve been feeling really tired, both mentally and physically, as STAAR testing approaches and school becomes more stressful. The hardest part right now is studying for the test and just getting up in the morning, which feels exhausting. To manage stress, I crochet and watch Netflix because they help me relax and take my mind off school. My goal for the rest of the year is to keep my grades up, and I stay motivated by reminding myself why it matters. When I feel overwhelmed, I talk to my dog because they listen without judgment and always bring me comfort.
# April 7, 2025
AI tools like ChatGPT or Khanmigo can help me get ready for the STAAR test by making things easier to understand. Sometimes I don’t get everything in class, and it’s hard to ask questions. But with AI, I can get help anytime I want. I can use it to go over questions, explain math problems step by step, or help me make a study plan. It’s like having a tutor that’s always there for me when I need it.

The best part for me would be if the AI told me what I need to work on and gave me tips. That way, I wouldn’t waste time studying things I already know. I think I would actually use it because sometimes I get stuck and don’t know where to start. If it helps me stay organized and feel more ready, I’d definitely try it.

Florida’s new law banning student cell phone use during the entire school day and blocking access to social media on school Wi-Fi has both good and bad sides. On one hand, I think the ban could help students focus better in class since phones can be a huge distraction. It might also lower the chances of cyberbullying during school hours. Without constant access to apps, students might pay more attention in class and even talk to each other more in person. It could make classrooms quieter and more focused, which can help both students and teachers.

On the other hand, I think there are some real downsides. If there’s an emergency, it could be harder for students to reach their parents quickly. Also, not being able to use your own phone at all during school feels a bit strict. It takes away students’ ability to manage their own time and responsibilities. If my school were to adopt these same rules, I’d probably be frustrated at first. I use my phone during lunch and in the hallway to check in with family or take a break. While I understand the reasoning, I’d prefer a policy that allows limited use during non-class times.

I don’t think 100 unarmed people could beat a silverback gorilla because gorillas are way too strong, fast, and aggressive when threatened. A silverback can weigh around 400 pounds and has the strength of about ten people, so even if the humans tried to make a plan, it would fall apart once chaos starts. Most people would panic or freeze, and the gorilla would overpower them easily. I also think making this kind of challenge go viral is irresponsible because it spreads the wrong message and makes people, especially kids, underestimate wild animals or think violence is funny. It shows how quickly crazy ideas can spread online just because they’re entertaining, even if they’re unrealistic or dangerous. That’s why we need to be careful about what we watch and share, because not everything trending is smart or safe.

The Titok Chromebook challenge is a mindless stunt kids should not do not only does it put themselves at risk but others, its dangerouse. Also putting the school property at risk intentionally should not be taking this action. Not only its a bad reflection of yourself but your actions tend to have consequences. We have responsibilities to the schools property to treat it correctly like if it was our own. Its not just a joke its can become a potential dangeorus situation that can lead to injuries or worse. We should use the internet as a positive source and we shoud shut down the "trends" that are harmful.

My thoughts on the the new cell phone policy I truly despise it because I cant contact my friends and I cant watch netflix during lunch which impacts me since im isolated and feel lonlely. I dont like it I feel like its was a rash decision that needed to include students opinions. Such as for daily use it helps me calm my anxiety and put my thoughts together. Moving to a new school was truly difficult I made some friends but now we dont share any classes together or even lunch. This leads for me to dread going to school since I cant talk to my friends and I see people aorund me who have friends. This makes me feel sad for myself. Ultimately it just isolates students which then contributes to the bigger idea of being in your head and feeling self concious.

For the presidential AI challenge my plan is to focus on healthcare services because many elder poeple have trouble submitting their information in order to be seen by a doctor. I plan to use artificial intelligance by having a program which talks to the patient asking them personal questions. In order for the AI to configure and sumbit the proper document. This would lead to less stressful doctor visits since many elderly people have no one to accompany them they will still have that extra support. Creating a sense of comfort between the patient and clinic.

To be hoenst I believe working at a virtual job would be a terrible idea because it promotes people to be lazy and not have a good healthy routine before work. If there starts being virtual jobs then it can lead to potential harmful routines that can lead to potentionally harming you. For instance not allowing indivuals to socialize and get out of their house which can promote the root cause of depression. Since a virtual job they cant see you therefore you dont have to look the part you can just be in your pjs but that always dosent help you in the long run. Futhermore virtual jobs may help the disabled community but can also have poetntial harmfull effects.

If i was the one in charge deciding in schools wether ai tools can be blocked my answer would be no. This is due to letting kids make their own choices and become responsible of their own lives. It promotes a sense of responsibility and decison making. It teaches them about the consequences in life and how their actions can affect them. Also if I just decided to ban everything the students would just work around it so theres no point.
