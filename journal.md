The three sensors that are found on the sphere bolt are compass sensor, ambient light sensor, and infrared sensor. 
The sphere bolt compass sensor functions by using a magnetometer. This allows the sphere to know it location once placed on earth (the floor). Basically the magnetometer is desgined to measure the magnetism of earth. Then once the measure of magnetic field helps to identify the magnetic north. This is why we can use BOLT as a compass.

Well in the lesson it was kinda confusing but once I read it made sense. Indeed I did encounter some challenges while following the steps from the lesson. Due to running into some bugs since I put the wrong code in such as await roll code. I probably misunderstood what the lesson wanted me to do since I needed to copy and paste since I didnt know how but my partner helped.

There are mutiple risk to AI but there are benefits that change many individuals lives signficantly. Such as AI has its own mind it can chose what to say depending on the code or program but it always has the final say in their action which is scary since every program can be ran and overan. AI has no emotions which is beneficial when decsion making since it will provide an answer based on facts and statistics. However AI in healthcare and school is essential since we have the ability to understand that skill and use it to our advatange which can be helpful when there IS A WORLD CRISIS. AND WE ARE AGAINST AI. Although Ai is helpful for daily helper like on homework or house assistance its vital for the safety of individuals such as cameras saves lives.

Computer science and technology impacts the election process significantly because now with the technology we use it makes the process to run smother and efficiently. One positive impact is that it makes the process to run faster. One potential challenge is that for elderly people they may not know how to vote since now we can online they may not know how to access it and some individuals may not have access to internet which creates a barrier.

Protecting personal and sensitive information when publishing online i crucial due to the potential risk assosicated with data breaches, identity theft, and privacy violations. Sharing too much information can lead to unwanted explotation making it essential to be cautious about what we disclose. To ensure the information shared on platforms like Github or social media remains secure several steps can be taken. First using a strong unqiue password and enabling 2 factor authethication can enhnace security. I have never shared something online but if I had i would imedialtly delet it and from my brain. Balancing openess an collaboration in online spaces especially in coding projects requires a thoughful approach it is possible to engage with others while maintaining privacy by sharing only relevant information and providing personal identifiers.

## Current Event
A new york judge recently postpones a decision on Donald Trump request to apply presidential immunity in his hush money case. Trump legal team argued that a recent Supreme Court ruling on presidential immunity might shield him from prosecution related to actions during his presidency. The delay extends the process, possibly impacting the timing of Trump sentencing, now tentatively scheduled for September 2024. This case involves allegations of fasifying business records to cover hush money payments linked to his 2006 presidential campaign. 
## Technology Application
Advancements in computer science and technology could have a substantial impact on cases like Trump by streamlining legal processes, enhancing transparency, and supporting data anaylsis. For instance AI tools could aid judges and attorneys in reviewing complex evidence more efficently, potentially analyzing social media and digital records for patterns relevant to official acts or personal actions. Blockchain technology could also improve record keeping in financial cases, securing evidence chains, and preventing data tampering, all of which might expediate legal processes in high profile cases such as Donald Trump case. Therefore the development of technology is extremely impactful to Donald Trump case since it can provide evidence and show how hes using the presidential election to his advantage.

Techonology has significantly transformed the food industry. Especially duirtng the peak seasons. In particular in how we grow, distribute, and purchase food. Advances in agriculture technology such as precision farming and GMO have increased crops and significantly reduces the costs of production. Also efficient logistics makes food more affordable and available. Online shopping adds convenience. However downsides include enviromental damage from intensive farming practices, potential biodiversity loss, and the vulnerability of small producers in the supply chains. The balance between techonological advancements and sustainability is crucial for a healthy and equitable food system.

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have significantly improved systems and control engineering, enabling real-time data analysis for better decision-making and efficiency. Technologies like deep learning, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing are enhancing industries such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, and voice recognition. These innovations are reshaping society by making processes more automated, efficient, and interactive. However, concerns about job displacement, accountability, and the ethical implications of AI decision-making remain. What excites me is the potential of AI to improve various sectors, but I am concerned about ensuring fairness and transparency in its applications. As AI evolves, it could be addressed by focusing on creating more interpretable, explainable, and ethical AI systems that balance innovation with societal responsibility.

To me, “brain rot” perfectly describes that drained, foggy feeling after spending too much time scrolling through pointless content. This year, I’ve felt both the good and bad sides of digital media. On one hand, it keeps me connected and entertained, but on the other, it’s easy to get stuck in a cycle of watching or reading things that feel like a waste of time. The word “slop” hits home because so much of what I see online, especially the AI-generated stuff, feels repetitive or low effort. But then there’s “lore,” which reminds me of how technology can also bring out creativity and community, like in fandoms or storytelling spaces. I think it’s possible to balance meaningful engagement with technology while avoiding brain rot, but it takes effort—like being intentional about what I consume and setting limits on how much time I spend online.
